    "1. **Completed Notebook 1** - Data must be imported into Neo4j\n",
    "2. **Neo4j running** with the `neo4j` database\n",
    "3. **GDS plugin installed** (version 2.3+)\n",
    "4. **Environment configured** - `.env` file with credentials\n",

    "**Expected Runtime**: 30-45 minutes for full dataset\n",

    "1. Community Detection (WCC, Leiden, Louvain) can help us to identify certain sectors within the graph.\n",
    "2. Node Similarity can help us to identify structurally similar nodes within the entire graph, or even down to just those sectors (good for when the graph is large)\n",
    "3. FastRP can help us to topologically encode every node in the graph + KNN allows us to get similarity another way (more approximate that Node Similarity)\n",
    "4. The basic text-matching rules which you may or may not be used to come into play at the very end of this process.\n",

    "The theory here is that, you can define some 'business rules' using a series of these filtration steps whereby 'if two people are this similar, and also have closely matching names, they are likely to be the same'. If you have enough supporting data, you could theoretically skip the name matching portion of this entirely.\n",

    "1. **Community Detection** - Used Louvain to partition the graph into ~260 communities\n",
    "2. **Degree Centrality** - Filtered out generic/spam mailboxes (degree > 19)\n",
    "3. **Node Similarity** - Found users with overlapping mailbox connections\n",
    "4. **String Matching** - Validated matches with Jaro-Winkler (85%+ similarity)\n",
    "5. **Connected Components** - Grouped all aliases into ResolvedEntity nodes\n",

    "**Results**: ~5,000 high-confidence entity matches identified and linked\n",
